## Hi! ðŸ¦‡ðŸ¦‡ðŸ¦‡

I am a biology graduate from Pontificia Universidad Javeriana Cali, Colombia, and I obtained my masterâ€™s degree at Instituto de EcologÃ­a (INECOL). Since the beginning of my career, I have been fascinated by the ecological and evolutionary patterns that shape the diversity of phyllostomid bats, with a special interest in their extraordinary trophic diversity. My undergraduate thesis explored the evolutionary relationship between diet and brain size in this family of bats, while my masterâ€™s research focused on how diet influences diversification rates in phyllostomid species. Currently, my doctoral research focuses on understanding the dimensions of dietary specialization and their relationship with rarity patterns in phyllostomids. I am passionate about phyllostomid bats, not only are they my favorite group, but I also believe they provide an exceptional model for understanding macroecological patterns related to diet.
